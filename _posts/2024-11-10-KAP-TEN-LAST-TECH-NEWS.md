# Kap10: This Week in Tech ‚Äì November 9th

**1. ChatGPT Gets Real-Time Web Search**  
OpenAI now offers real-time web search with ChatGPT. Initially available to paid users, this feature will gradually roll out to all, positioning ChatGPT more competitively against Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini.

**2. Social Network Friendster Hits 275 Million Users**  
Launched in July 2023, Friendster has already reached 275 million monthly active users, though it continues to grapple with moderation challenges to maintain a safe space for all users.

**3. X's New User Blocking Policy Sparks Debate**  
X (formerly Twitter) has altered its blocking feature: blocked users can still view some public information. This decision, defended by Elon Musk, raises questions about compliance with Apple and Google‚Äôs user safety policies.

**4. Meta Scraps Nuclear-Powered Data Center Project**  
Due to the discovery of a rare bee species, Meta has abandoned plans for a nuclear-powered data center. The company continues to explore other clean energy solutions to reduce its environmental footprint.

**5. Japan‚Äôs Wooden Satellite in Space**  
In a world-first, Japan launched a wooden satellite, LIGOSAT, into orbit to test wood's resilience under extreme space conditions, aiming to offer a greener alternative to traditional metal satellites.

**6. Mozilla Lays Off 30% of Workforce**  
Mozilla has announced a major restructuring, cutting 30% of its workforce (around 120 employees) in a move to enhance organizational agility.

**7. Apple Facing Record EU Fine for Market Abuse**  
Apple may face a $38 billion fine for breaching the European Digital Markets Act. This unprecedented penalty is expected to be confirmed by the European Commission later this month.

**8. Elon Musk‚Äôs Political Influence in the U.S.**  
Musk‚Äôs investment in Trump‚Äôs campaign has boosted Tesla shares by 15%. In return, Trump is expected to appoint Musk to a government efficiency commission if re-elected.

**9. Google‚Äôs New AI Assistant, Jarvis, Accidentally Revealed**  
Powered by an advanced version of Gemini, Jarvis promises to automate daily web tasks, intensifying the tech race among major AI players.

**10. OpenAI‚Äôs Ad-Free Web Search Stance**  
Unlike other platforms, OpenAI has stated it will not introduce ads in its real-time web search feature, addressing rising ethical concerns in the industry.
