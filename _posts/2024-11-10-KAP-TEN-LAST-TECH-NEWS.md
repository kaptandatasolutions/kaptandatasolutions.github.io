# Kap10: This Week in Tech – November 9th

**1. ChatGPT Gets Real-Time Web Search**  
OpenAI now offers real-time web search with ChatGPT. Initially available to paid users, this feature will gradually roll out to all, positioning ChatGPT more competitively against Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini.

**2. Social Network Friendster Hits 275 Million Users**  
Launched in July 2023, Friendster has already reached 275 million monthly active users, though it continues to grapple with moderation challenges to maintain a safe space for all users.

**3. X's New User Blocking Policy Sparks Debate**  
X (formerly Twitter) has altered its blocking feature: blocked users can still view some public information. This decision, defended by Elon Musk, raises questions about compliance with Apple and Google’s user safety policies.

**4. Meta Scraps Nuclear-Powered Data Center Project**

Apple may face a $38 billion fine for breaching the European Digital Markets Act. This unprecedented penalty is expected to be confirmed by the European Commission later this month.

**8. Elon Musk’s Political Influence in the U.S.**  
Musk’s investment in Trump’s campaign has boosted Tesla shares by 15%. In return, Trump is expected to appoint Musk to a government efficiency commission if re-elected.

**9. Google’s New AI Assistant, Jarvis, Accidentally Revealed**  
Powered by an advanced version of Gemini, Jarvis promises to automate daily web tasks, intensifying the tech race among major AI players.
