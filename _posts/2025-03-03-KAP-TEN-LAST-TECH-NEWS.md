**Top 10 Tech News (March 3, 2025)**

## 1. Alexa Plus: Amazon's Voice Assistant Reinvented

Amazon takes a giant leap forward with **Alexa Plus**. This new version of the intelligent assistant now incorporates generative AI, enabling it to engage in more natural conversations—with hesitations and nuances reminiscent of human exchanges. According to the podcast, Alexa no longer merely responds to rigid commands: it anticipates your needs, adjusts its tone based on your mood, and expands its ecosystem with a broad array of *skills*. Best of all, this service will be available for $19.99 per month (free for Prime subscribers), a pricing strategy aimed at strengthening Amazon's leadership in the voice assistant market.
