# Transform Your Quality Control with Our Automated SPC Solution

In the ever-evolving field of radiotherapy, maintaining the highest standards of quality control is paramount. That’s why we at **Kaptan Data Solutions** are excited to introduce our automated **Web SPC Solution**—a powerful tool designed to streamline the analysis and monitoring of quality control data, seamlessly integrated into your center's internal network. 

## Automate Your Quality Control Processes

Imagine a system that not only simplifies the collection and analysis of your quality control data but also provides real-time insights into process stability and performance. Our SPC solution does just that. It generates various control charts—such as Performance, EWMA, Bayesian, and X Bar—allowing you to monitor key metrics effortlessly. 

An integrated algorithm works diligently behind the scenes, detecting and automatically removing outlier data using the IQR functionality, ensuring that your analyses are not only accurate but also meaningful. This automation means less time spent on manual data checks and more time focusing on patient care.

This process transitions the distribution from a "t" distribution to a "LogGamma" distribution, thereby enhancing the monitoring of capability indices (Cp, Cpk, and Cpm). This transition accurately reflects the true performance of the process.


## Real-Time Monitoring from Anywhere

One of the standout features of our SPC solution is its accessibility. You can view SPC analysis results in real time from any computer connected to your network. Simply enter a local address in your web browser, and you’ll have immediate access to all your quality control metrics. This flexibility empowers your team to monitor performance on the go, making informed decisions faster.

You can see the settings applied to this chart, which can be adjusted to align with your expectations. This flexibility allows for increased responsiveness in detecting genuine process shifts while minimizing false alarms related to process drift.



## Comprehensive Reporting for Streamlined Documentation

Documentation and traceability are essential in any quality control process. Our solution allows users to download a complete PDF report of the analysis, customizable with personal information and comments. This ensures streamlined traceability and effective documentation of all quality controls, making audits and reviews simpler and more efficient.

## Explore the Demo

To help you get started, we offer a demo version of our SPC solution on our portfolio website. Here, users can download sample datasets and explore the tool's features before full integration into your radiotherapy center.
