This Web SPC solution provides an automated and accessible tool for the analysis and monitoring of quality control data in radiotherapy, directly integrated into the center's internal network. The application generates control charts (Performance, EWMA, Bayesian, X Bar, etc.) to monitor process stability and performance. An integrated algorithm detects and automatically removes outlier data using the IQR functionality. SPC analysis results are generated automatically and can be viewed in real time from any computer connected to the network via a simple local address in a web browser.

Additionally, users can download a full PDF report of the analysis, customizable with their information and comments, ensuring streamlined traceability and documentation of quality controls.

A demo version of the solution is available on our portfolio website, allowing users to download sample datasets and explore the tool's features before full integration into your radiotherapy center.
