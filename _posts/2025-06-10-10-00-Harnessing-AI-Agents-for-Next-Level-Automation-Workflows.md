Automation is evolving beyond rigid, predetermined logic into a dynamic ecosystem where intelligent agents can make decisions, execute tasks, and even interact with various services on your behalf. In this guide, we explore a new paradigm that incorporates AI agents within an automation platform, empowering users to build workflows that adapt in real time and execute complex operations without the need to predefine every branch.

In the traditional automation setup, you had to specify every possible path: ‚Äúif this event occurs, then do that.‚Äù Today, with the advanced AI agent module, you are provided with a trigger module that not only launches a workflow but then passes control to an intelligent agent. This agent is equipped with a prompt‚Äîits set of initial instructions‚Äîand a variety of tools that serve as its superpowers. The outcome is a more creative, flexible and less deterministic approach to building your automation scenarios.

Below, we break down how to create and integrate these AI agents into your workflows and outline a couple of practical examples that illustrate their potential.

Step 1: Setting Up Your AI Agent

‚Ä¢ Begin at the central interface of your automation platform where the new AI agent module is accessible.  
‚Ä¢ Create a new agent by clicking the creation button.  
‚Ä¢ Choose an appropriate language model to serve as the agent‚Äôs ‚Äúbrain.‚Äù Different providers might be available, allowing you to select one that meets your performance and cost expectations.  
‚Ä¢ Name your agent (for example, ‚ÄúConversation and Analysis Agent‚Äù) and enter an introductory prompt. The prompt defines the agent‚Äôs role and decision-making guidelines. For instance, you may start with a simple instruction: ‚ÄúYou are an assistant who helps answer daily inquiries.‚Äù
  
With these basic steps, you now have an agent waiting for an input trigger.

Step 2: Connecting the Agent to a Triggered Event

One of the exciting aspects of AI agents is the ease with which they integrate with common communication tools. Consider the example of connecting your agent to a Slack channel:  
‚Ä¢ Within your workflow, select the option to trigger an agent whenever a new message is posted in a designated channel (e.g., a channel named ‚Äútest agent‚Äù).  
‚Ä¢ Configure the automation to call the appropriate agent. If necessary, add a condition to exclude messages generated by the agent itself to avoid feedback loops.
  
When the agent receives a trigger from Slack, it executes its prompt and responds. Once the setup is properly configured, sending a message in the channel should prompt the agent to analyze the message and reply appropriately.

Step 3: Empowering the Agent with Tools

For an AI agent to be truly useful, it needs access to external tools that let it go beyond simple conversation. Here‚Äôs how to add them:  
‚Ä¢ In the agent configuration, you can add individual tools. Each tool is essentially a preconfigured automation scenario (set in on-demand mode) connected to a specific task.  
‚Ä¢ As an initial example, add a tool for searching your customer database. This tool might call an external database (like an Airtable base) and return a list of clients matching given parameters.  
‚Ä¢ In the agent‚Äôs workflow, ensure the input (for example, a message like ‚Äúlist my clients‚Äù) passes along any necessary parameters, so the agent knows which tool to use. Once the tool returns the desired output, the agent can format the response and send it back to Slack or another communication platform.

Step 4: Example ‚Äì Customer Support Agent

Imagine you need an agent for after-sales support that not only replies to inquiries but also performs actions such as sending an email or SMS based on the severity level of a support ticket. Here‚Äôs the process:  
‚Ä¢ Create a new agent and configure its prompt with clear instructions. For example: ‚ÄúYou are a support agent. Your goal is to assess a customer ticket's severity level and, if the level is 5, send an SMS while always composing a support response.‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ Assign relevant tools to this agent, such as ‚Äúsend text message,‚Äù ‚Äúsend email,‚Äù and ‚Äúupdate support ticket.‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ Build a trigger for this agent by linking it to a support ticket form (for instance, using a module that watches for new tickets in a database or on a tool like Notion).  
‚Ä¢ Pass the details of the ticket (including its content and any relevant numeric indicators for priority) so the agent can decide which tools to invoke. If the severity is high, the agent will execute the SMS tool; otherwise, it may only update the ticket with its analysis and responses.
  
Testing the scenario should show that upon filling out a support ticket with critical details, the agent both updates the ticket information and, if required, sends an SMS alert ‚Äî all based on the instructions set within its prompt.

Step 5: Expanding Your Automation Possibilities

By combining the agent‚Äôs ability to understand natural language with robust tools available through the automation platform, you open a world of possibilities:
  
‚Ä¢ Manage inventory by having the agent check stock levels, trigger orders, and send notifications via Slack or email.  
‚Ä¢ Create a mail management agent that reads categorized emails, drafts responses, and applies labels without manually defined branches for each rule.  
‚Ä¢ Develop a customer care assistant that follows up on client interactions, sends resources, or offers tailored benefits based on user activity or purchase history.
  
The key is to articulate your needs clearly using the right prompt. Tools can be as simple as individual scenarios or workflows, yet when combined with a well-engineered prompt, they transform your automation approach dramatically.

Final Thoughts

This new stage of automation‚Äîwhere AI agents are empowered with tools and guided by precise prompts‚Äîmarks a transition from level‚Äë1 deterministic scheduling to a more dynamic, level‚Äë2 environment where agents can enact real-time decisions. As you experiment with these agents, remember that the quality of your prompt directly affects the agent‚Äôs intelligence. Often, sketching out your automation concept on paper first can lead to smoother implementation and better outcomes.

By starting with clear needs rather than just the latest gadget, you ensure that the solutions you build are both practical and transformative. Experiment with different tasks and observe how even small changes in the prompt can lead to significantly smarter agent behavior.
