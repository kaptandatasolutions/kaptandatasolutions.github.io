# Top 10 Tech News of the Week

The world of technology is constantly evolving, bringing us innovations that challenge our perceptions of what's possible and reshaping our daily lives. From sentient robots to AI's expanding influence, this past week has been no exception. Here‚Äôs a rundown of the top 10 tech stories that are making waves and defining the future.

## 1. The Rise of Figure 03: Your Future Home-Help Robot

Imagine a world where your robot tidies up, washes dishes, and even walks the dog. This future is rapidly approaching with Figure 03, the latest humanoid robot from the Silicon Valley startup Figure. Revealed in a captivating video, this third-generation robot promises unprecedented fluidity and near-human capabilities. Unlike its predecessors, Figure 03 is designed to learn directly from humans, making it a versatile assistant for domestic chores. From sorting laundry to picking up toys, its potential applications are vast. While still in development with no price announced, the company's ambitious production goals of 12,000 robots annually and 100,000 in four years signal a serious intent to bring these machines into our homes and workplaces.

## 2. AI's Double-Edged Sword: Growing Concerns and Calls for Regulation

As AI advances at breakneck speed, a chorus of cautionary voices is growing louder. Experts and NGOs are advocating for global red lines and ethical guidelines to govern AI development. Figures like Joshua Benjou and Geoffrey Hinton, prominent AI researchers, have openly expressed their anxieties about the technology's long-term implications. Activists are even staging hunger strikes, highlighting fears that unchecked AI could evolve into a "poison" for humanity. While a "Terminator" scenario may seem far-fetched, concerns range from malicious use in cybercrime and chemical warfare to the more immediate societal impacts on employment and privacy. This debate underscores the urgent need for political leadership to anticipate and manage the profound transformations AI will bring.

## 3. Deloitte's AI Blunder: The Cost of Over-Reliance

The consulting firm Deloitte recently faced significant repercussions in Australia for submitting an AI-generated report riddled with errors. The report, commissioned by the Department of Employment, contained fabricated references, non-existent judicial citations, fictional scientific articles, and even a forged federal court judgment. This incident serves as a stark reminder that while AI can be a powerful tool, it requires human oversight and critical evaluation. Over-reliance without due diligence can lead to costly mistakes, reputation damage, and a loss of trust in AI-generated content.

## 4. Open AI Predicts Job Market Disruption: Who‚Äôs Next?

The advent of large language models like ChatGPT has ignited widespread debate about the future of work. Open AI itself recently published a list of 44 professions particularly vulnerable to automation by generative AI across nine profitable sectors in the United States. Translators and programmers top the list, but the impact extends to seemingly "human" roles such as psychologists, social workers, nurses, pharmacists, and even detectives. This doesn't necessarily mean these jobs will disappear entirely, but rather that a significant portion of their tasks could be efficiently handled by AI, compelling professionals to adapt and evolve their skill sets.

## 5. Quantum Computing's Nobel Recognition and Security Implications

Quantum computing took center stage as French physicist Michel Devoret, alongside John Clark and John Martinis, received the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking work on quantum circuits. Their discoveries pave the way for quantum computers, which promise exponentially faster and more efficient calculations, revolutionizing fields from medicine to materials science. However, this advancement also poses a significant threat to current encryption methods, raising concerns about data security.

## 6. Thales' Quantum Leap: The First Quantum-Resistant Smart Card

In response to the looming threat of quantum attacks on existing encryption, the French group Thales has developed a pioneering quantum-resistant smart card. This is a monumental step forward in cybersecurity, offering the first such card in Europe to integrate post-quantum cryptography. Certified with the highest security level (Common Criteria EAL6+) by ANSSI, France's cybersecurity agency, this innovation is designed to protect sensitive data on electronic IDs, health cards, and driving licenses from future quantum computer decryption capabilities. This proactive measure ensures long-term identity security in an increasingly quantum-powered world.

## 7. Open AI‚Äôs Ambitious Platform Play: ChatGPT as the Universal Interface

Open AI is setting its sights on transforming ChatGPT from a mere chatbot into a monolithic platform, a "super app" in the making. The company plans to integrate third-party applications, allowing users to access services like Booking.com, Spotify, and Trip Advisor directly through the ChatGPT interface. This ambitious move aims to create a single entry point for a multitude of digital services, streamlining user experience and potentially redefining how we interact with technology. While this vision promises convenience, it also raises questions about market dominance and data control within the tech ecosystem.

## 8. Google's AI Mode: A Geopolitical Tug-of-War

Google recently rolled out its "AI Mode," an enhanced search feature that provides AI-generated summaries and conversational interactions for complex queries. While this innovation promises a more intuitive search experience, its availability is geographically limited. Curiously, it‚Äôs not yet available in France, despite being offered in other European countries like Switzerland and Belgium, and even parts of Canada. This disparity highlights ongoing tensions between Google and French regulators, particularly concerning "neighboring rights" and content remuneration. Google views this as a regulatory hurdle impeding France's access to cutting-edge AI, while critics suggest it might be a strategic retaliation.

## 9. The Frogans Project: A New Vision for the Web

A French engineering team, with Frogans as its partner, is embarking on an ambitious journey to complement the existing World Wide Web. Inspired by Tim Berners-Lee's original vision, Frogans aims to introduce a new web standard where sites are no longer confined to rectangular borders but can exist visually with any shape on a screen. This open-standard system seeks to enhance the visual and interactive dimensions of the internet, offering a fresh perspective on digital content presentation. The project is currently seeking investment through a public offering to acquire shares in F2R2, the initiative's parent company.

## 10. The Ultimate Useless Gadget: The "Machine"

From the mind of Olivier Mevel comes "The Machine," a captivatingly absurd gadget. This 7cm cube, when activated, opens its lid, and a robotic arm emerges to switch itself off. Inspired by Marvin Minsky's "Ultimate Machine" from 1952, this modern iteration incorporates sound, varied arm movements, and a sleek, designer aesthetic. While undeniably useless in a functional sense, its purpose lies in sparking reflection about utility itself, and perhaps offering a poetic, interactive distraction. Priced as a high-end novelty, it's slated for release in February 2026.
