### Automating Precision: Simplifying the Complex with Winston-Lutz 2D & 3D Analysis

We know that accuracy is paramount in your field. That’s why our **Winston-Lutz tools** automate the intricate task of analyzing beam misalignment with exceptional precision. Once you upload your **EPID images** (whether a single file for 2D or a ZIP file for 3D analysis), our tools handle everything—from analyzing **ball bearing (BB) position** to calculating deviations between the **central axis (CAX)** and **BB**.

The 2D tool is designed for quick and straightforward analysis, perfect for routine checks, while the 3D tool dives deeper, analyzing multiple gantry, collimator, and table angles for a full 3D positioning assessment. Both tools provide instant, actionable results—so you can focus on clinical decision-making instead of manual calculations.

**Future-ready**: Our upcoming updates will feature **fully integrated workflows** for real-time image fetching from your radiotherapy center’s network. This means that soon, EPID images can be automatically processed and analyzed without any manual uploads.

### Comprehensive Control with Customizable Parameters

While our tools are automated, we know that flexibility is essential. That’s why we've integrated key customization options to tailor each analysis to your exact needs. Whether you're adjusting the **BB size**, **reference angles**, or **tolerance settings**, our tools adapt to fit your clinical protocols.

Key adjustable settings include:
- **BB Size**: Define the size of the ball bearing used in your analysis.
- **Open Field Analysis**: Center the field on the EPID for more precise open-field measurements.
- **Align BB with Radiation Isocenter**: Apply a virtual shift to align the BB perfectly with the radiation isocenter for highly accurate results.
- **Gantry/Collimator/Table Angle Reference**: Adjust angles according to your measurement protocols for complete alignment accuracy.
