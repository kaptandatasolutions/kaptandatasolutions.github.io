# Discover the Automated **Winston-Lutz 2D & 3D Analysis Tools** by Kaptan Data Solutions

At **Kaptan Data Solutions**, we're dedicated to enhancing precision and efficiency in medical physics. Our latest tools for **Winston-Lutz 2D** and **3D analysis** bring the power of automation and the accuracy of the **PYLINAC** library right to your fingertips. These tools streamline the entire process of **EPID image analysis**, delivering faster, more accurate results for radiation therapy centers.

Whether you're analyzing a single EPID image in **2D** or handling multiple EPID images stored in a ZIP file for **3D Winston-Lutz analysis**, our tools take care of the heavy lifting. Built on the robust `WinstonLutz.analyze()` function from **PYLINAC**, they ensure precision while minimizing manual input.

Curious to try them out? [**Experience the online demo for 2D analysis**](https://kaptan-data.streamlit.app/winston-lutz_2d) or [**Explore the 3D analysis demo**](https://kaptan-data.streamlit.app/winston-lutz_3d).

### Automating Precision: Simplifying the Complex with Winston-Lutz 2D & 3D Analysis

We know that accuracy is paramount in your field. That‚Äôs why our **Winston-Lutz tools** automate the intricate task of analyzing beam misalignment with exceptional precision. Once you upload your **EPID images** (whether a single file for 2D or a ZIP file for 3D analysis), our tools handle everything‚Äîfrom analyzing **ball bearing (BB) position** to calculating deviations between the **central axis (CAX)** and **BB**.

The 2D tool is designed for quick and straightforward analysis, perfect for routine checks, while the 3D tool dives deeper, analyzing multiple gantry, collimator, and table angles for a full 3D positioning assessment. Both tools provide instant, actionable results‚Äîso you can focus on clinical decision-making instead of manual calculations.

**Future-ready**: Our upcoming updates will feature **fully integrated workflows** for real-time image fetching from your radiotherapy center‚Äôs network. This means that soon, EPID images can be automatically processed and analyzed without any manual uploads.

### Comprehensive Control with Customizable Parameters

While our tools are automated, we know that flexibility is essential. That‚Äôs why we've integrated key customization options to tailor each analysis to your exact needs. Whether you're adjusting the **BB size**, **reference angles**, or **tolerance settings**, our tools adapt to fit your clinical protocols.

Key adjustable settings include:
- **BB Size**: Define the size of the ball bearing used in your analysis.
- **Open Field Analysis**: Center the field on the EPID for more precise open-field measurements.
- **Align BB with Radiation Isocenter**: Apply a virtual shift to align the BB perfectly with the radiation isocenter for highly accurate results.
- **Gantry/Collimator/Table Angle Reference**: Adjust angles according to your measurement protocols for complete alignment accuracy.

### Real-Time Visual Feedback and Detailed Reporting

Both the **2D** and **3D Winston-Lutz tools** offer real-time visual results, giving you immediate feedback on the image alignment and positioning errors. With processed images that clearly mark the **CAX**, **BB**, and other critical elements, you can visually confirm the results and identify any misalignments at a glance.

Once the analysis is complete, you can download a fully customizable **PDF report**. Add your personal details and comments to create a professional, comprehensive record of each test. This feature is perfect for quality assurance documentation, ensuring that all results are stored accurately and ready for audit.
