# Discover the Automated DICOM Analysis Tool by Kaptan Data Solutions

At **Kaptan Data Solutions**, we are revolutionizing how medical physicists analyze their DICOM images. Our goal is to make data analysis not only faster and more accurate but also more accessible to every professional in the field. That's why we've developed a fully **automated tool** that streamlines and optimizes complex image analyses, including the Picket Fence test, with unmatched efficiency.

What's more, we integrate the power of **PYLINAC**, a renowned Python library specifically designed for quality assurance in medical physics. By leveraging the **PicketFence** module of PYLINAC, we've extracted the very **nectar** of its capabilities to provide you with seamless automation. The **pf.analyze()** function, the backbone of our tool, ensures precise and reliable test results with minimal input. You can explore the full potential of this function in the official [PicketFence documentation](https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/picketfence.html#).

### Smart Automation: Save Time While Maintaining Precision

We understand that every minute counts in your work, and accuracy in testing is crucial. While our current demo requires users to manually upload DICOM files, the real power of our tool lies in its ability to be integrated into the radiotherapy center's network service. In a fully automated setup, the tool will independently fetch images from a dedicated directory, analyze them, and generate Picket Fence reports without any manual intervention.

Imagine a workflow where the tool continuously monitors your DICOM repository, automatically running analyses and compiling reports—all in real time. This isn’t just image analysis; it’s a revolution in how medical data is processed, significantly enhancing efficiency and precision in clinical settings.

### Complete Control Over Tolerances and Results

Our tool also gives you the flexibility to customize your tolerance settings, allowing you to adapt precisely to your needs. Whether you want to tweak tolerance values or get a visual preview of your analysis with markers and color-coded lines, it’s all just a click away. Achieving this level of control and accuracy has never been easier.
