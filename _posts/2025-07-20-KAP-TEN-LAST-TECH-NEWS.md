# Top 10 Tech News of the Week

Discover the cutting edge of technology with our latest weekly roundup! From groundbreaking advancements in robotic surgery and AI to critical discussions on digital privacy and the future of foldable phones, this week has been packed with innovation and important developments.

## 1. Robotic Surgery Breakthrough: Autonomous Operations

A significant milestone was achieved in the medical field with a robot performing surgery in near-total autonomy. Researchers at John Hopkins University showcased a robot, named `srt-H`, that successfully completed a gallbladder removal on a deceased pig without human intervention. This robot can respond to vocal commands, understand instructions like "grasp the head of the gallbladder," and, crucially, auto-correct its actions. Trained on 17 hours of real surgical footage and analyzing 18,000 human gestures, `srt-H` demonstrated 100% precision, even when faced with simulated blood or altered tissue textures. While it took longer than a human surgeon, its rigor and decision-making were expert-level. This development suggests a future where AI and robotics could significantly assist or even enable complex interventions in remote hospitals, expanding access to advanced medical care.

## 2. OpenAI Introduces ChatGPT Agent: The AI That Acts

OpenAI has launched its first AI agent, `ChatGPT Agent`, marking a new era for AI capabilities. Unlike traditional generative AIs that merely produce text or images, `ChatGPT Agent` can perform actions like a human. This includes browsing websites, launching applications, clicking menus, and filling out forms. Potentially, it could book travel, schedule appointments, or complete e-commerce purchases. Operating within a virtual PC environment, it connects to any website, explaining its actions and requesting user consent for sensitive tasks such as password entry or transaction finalization. This agent is a fusion of OpenAI's existing `Operator` and `Deep Research` tools, and it will replace `Operator`. It is currently available for `Pro`, `Plus`, and `Team` subscribers.

## 3. Voice is the New Interface: AI-Powered Transcription and Translation

The integration of voice technology into AI tools is rapidly expanding. ChatGPT now accepts audio files, allowing users to upload meeting recordings for transcription and summarization (though this feature is still rolling out). In France, the startup Mistral has released `Voxstral`, an open-source voice recognition engine that supports multiple languages for transcription. This technology could enable hands-free interaction with devices, such as answering calls or controlling car functions, with Stellantis already testing it. Furthermore, a Slovenian app called "Sony" offers real-time transcription and translation in over 60 languages, including less common ones. Noteworthy for its speed and efficiency, Sony automatically detects languages and speaker identification, offering a seamless communication experience previously limited to high-end devices like Samsung's.

## 4. Apple Rumors: Mistral Acquisition and Foldable iPhone Future

Persistent rumors suggest Apple's interest in acquiring the French AI startup Mistral. This interest highlights Apple's efforts to catch up in the generative AI race, a topic previously discussed as a possibility. While still a rumor, it has sparked considerable debate, with some experts doubting the likelihood of such a deal due to Apple's typical acquisition strategies. Meanwhile, the long-awaited foldable iPhone might finally materialize by late 2026. Rumors indicate Apple is developing a `fold`-type device that opens like a wallet to reveal a screen nearly the size of a small iPad, contrasting with `flip`-style phones. This premium device is estimated to cost over €2,500. Apple is reportedly focusing on perfecting the screen crease and hinge using "Liquid Metal," a lightweight and resistant material already used in smaller Apple accessories.

## 5. Startup Wars: The Unfolding Drama in AI Acquisition

The competitive landscape of AI startups has seen dramatic twists. OpenAI initially attempted to acquire Winsurf, an American startup specializing in AI-generated code, for $3 billion, but the deal fell through. Google DeepMind then stepped in, but to avoid antitrust issues, it recruited Winsurf's CEO and several employees, securing licenses for certain technologies for $2.4 billion, likely intending to acquire the rest of the company later. However, a surprising third player, Cognition (a startup behind the AI agent Devin), swooped in, signing an agreement to acquire the remaining parts of Winsurf. This intricate saga underscores the intense competition and the high stakes involved in the race for AI talent and technology, where even tech giants can be outmaneuvered by agile startups.

## 6. Major Cybercrime Bust: Pro-Russian Hacker Network Dismantled

Europol and Eurojust, Europe's police and justice agencies, successfully dismantled `Noame 057 16`, a massive pro-Russian cybercriminal network. This group is believed to be responsible for over 74,000 attacks worldwide since 2023, including 2,200 in France, targeting critical infrastructure like power grids and public transport. Notable incidents include the paralysis of the French National Assembly's website and RATP's sites in Canada. attacks by denial of service, where sites are overwhelmed with connection requests to block access. While not stealing data, these attacks aimed to disrupt. Suspects have been identified, acting without official directives from Russian authorities but motivated by ideology and financial rewards through a gamified system that paid smaller hackers in cryptocurrency.

## 7. Digital Privacy: Age Verification for Adult Content

France has mandated age verification for pornographic websites. The Council of State upheld a government decree, requiring sites to implement anonymous age verification methods that ensure dual anonymity (neither the user's identity to the site nor to the verification tool). This includes popular sites like Pornhub and X-Hamster, many of which are hosted outside France in countries like Cyprus or Luxembourg. While some sites initially blocked French users in response, the government is now asserting tighter control. This move is part of a broader European effort; five European countries (France, Italy, Spain, Greece, and Denmark) are trialing a common age verification application developed by the European Commission. The goal is to establish a European standard to protect minors from adult content, violence, and social media harms, with France aiming for a minimum age of 15 for social media accounts.

## 8. Luc Julia on Generative AI: Beyond LLMs and the Quest for Frugality

In a discussion about the Chinese AI model "Dipsic," co-inventor of Siri, Luc Julia, expressed skepticism about the long-term viability of current generative AI models like large language models (LLMs). While Dipsic boasts impressive performance at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI's models, its methods are suspected to involve a form of data "distillation," possibly akin to plagiarism. Julia believes that the future of AI lies in specialized, more frugal models, moving away from resource-intensive, generic LLMs. He argues that the environmental impact, particularly the vast energy and water consumption of large data centers, makes the current approach unsustainable. He sees initiatives like Dipsic, if genuinely more resource-efficient, as a step towards a necessary shift towards more ethical and sustainable AI development.

## 9. Bruno Maisonnier's Vision: Organic AI Inspired by the Human Brain

Bruno Maisonnier, founder of Aldebaran Robotics (creators of Pepper and Nao robots) and co-founder of Another Brain, envisions a new form of artificial intelligence based on the human brain's cortical cells. Drawing inspiration from the 1981 Nobel Prize in Medicine, Maisonnier highlights the brain's "cortical columns"—200 million identical, interconnected units that collectively perform all intelligent functions. He likens this to the cooperative behavior of ants or bees. Another Brain is actively working to model these biological processes into algorithms, aiming to build a truly intelligent AI that functions like the human brain. Maisonnier believes this "organic AI" offers a unique path to technological independence and sovereignty for France and Europe, allowing them to compete with tech giants by pursuing a fundamentally different approach.

## 10. The Power of Immersive Video: Reliving Moments with Immersive Flashback

Immersive Flashback, a French company co-founded by Franck David Cohen, showcased its innovative immersive video technology during the Bastille Day parade. A unique camera with two stereo lenses, designed for 180-degree stereoscopic capture, was positioned strategically—including behind President Emmanuel Macron's car as he descended the Champs-Élysées. The goal is to offer viewers an unprecedented, teleporting experience using Apple Vision Pro headsets. This technology creates "time capsules" that allow viewers to relive moments with a sense of true presence, seeing everything in 3D relief, as if they were actually there. The footage from the parade will be displayed at the Maison de l'Élysée and during the European Heritage Days in September, offering the public a privileged and highly realistic perspective of these historic events.
