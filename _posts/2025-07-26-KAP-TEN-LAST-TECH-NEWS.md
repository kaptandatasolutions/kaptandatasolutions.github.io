# Top 10 Tech News of the Week

Here's your weekly dose of the most impactful developments shaping the world of technology, from AI policy shifts to groundbreaking innovations.

## 1. Europe's AI Act Takes Effect Amidst Industry Divergence

The European Union's ambitious AI Act (or IA Act) is on the verge of implementation, starting August 2nd. This landmark regulation aims to impose strict rules on major AI systems, with obligations ranging from transparency and security to bias control and usage oversight. While it's a pragmatic, unprecedented approach, particularly given Europe's limited AI development, it seeks to establish a global framework similar to GDPR. A transitional "code of good conduct" was introduced for voluntary signing, allowing early adopters a smoother path. However, not everyone is onboard, setting the stage for significant shifts in how AI is developed and deployed within Europe.

## 2. Meta Resists EU's AI Code, Signaling Potential Friction

In a notable act of defiance, Meta has opted not to sign the EU's voluntary code of good conduct for AI. The tech giant cites concerns over the need to reveal sensitive operational details of its AI models, fearing potential copying, misuse, or even the blocking of certain functionalities. Meta also worries about the economic consequences of an overly regulated European market, suggesting it might hinder the rollout of its solutions in the region. This stance could expose Meta to far stricter enforcement under the act, potentially leading to fines up to 7% of its global revenue. This highlights a fundamental tension between regulatory ambition and industry freedom.

## 3. The United States Adopts a Deregulatory AI Stance

In stark contrast to Europe, the United States, under its current administration, is embracing a highly deregulated approach to artificial intelligence. A new action plan includes 90 measures designed to dismantle existing barriers to AI innovation. This includes rolling back regulations aimed at mitigating AI risks and collateral effects, previously championed by the prior administration. Furthermore, there's a strong push against AI models perceived as "too woke," with government services prohibited from using AI software promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, or certain elements related to climate change. This divergence creates a fascinating global landscape for AI development, raising questions about competitive advantage and ethical frameworks.

## 4. ChatGPT Continues to Break Records and Prepares for Version 5

No surprise here: ChatGPT remains a dominant force in the AI world, shattering user engagement records. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has revealed that ChatGPT is now handling an astonishing 2.5 billion daily requests. This surge in usage underscores the pervasive integration of AI conversational tools into daily life. Looking ahead, the anticipation for ChatGPT Version 5 is building, with promises of an even more powerful and intelligent model. This continuous evolution highlights the rapid pace of AI advancement and its growing capabilities.

## 5. AI's Influence on Human Communication Styles

An intriguing byproduct of widespread AI adoption is its subtle yet significant impact on human communication. Studies suggest that frequent interaction with AI chatbots is reshaping how we speak and write, making us less verbose and more structured. Users tend to adopt simpler syntactic structures, more neutral language, and increased use of logical connectors (e.g., "however," "in contrast," "thus"). While this might lead to more polished and articulate expression, concerns are emerging, particularly among younger users, that it could stifle imagination and deviate from conventional thinking patterns. The "chatbot style" appears to be rubbing off on us, influencing not just our word choice but also how we formulate ideas.

## 6. Microsoft SharePoint Targeted in Major Cyberattack

Thousands of organizations worldwide, including sensitive government agencies, are reeling from a massive cyberattack exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft's SharePoint collaboration software. While the effects became prominent in mid-July, the critical flaw has been known for some time and is believed to have been exploited by state-sponsored hackers, reportedly linked to China. The particular concern is that this vulnerability doesn't reside in the cloud but directly on user terminals, making it a more insidious threat. Beyond espionage, some hacker groups are using this access to deploy ransomware, locking down organizational data and demanding ransoms. Over 400 organizations have already been compromised, underscoring the severe risks of software vulnerabilities at scale.

## 7. New Measures to Combat Telephone Spam and Scams

Annoying and often fraudulent telephone calls are a pervasive problem, but new solutions are emerging to combat them. Services like the French BlockTel allow users to register their numbers to reduce unsolicited calls. Mobile applications such as Bigone and Orange T√©l√©phone also offer robust spam blocking features. Looking ahead, the French telecoms regulator, ARCEP, plans to launch a public consultation to further improve protection. Proposed measures include operator-level authentication for calls; for instance, international calls from mobile numbers (starting 06 or 07) would be converted into a generic "99999" format on recipient phones, making them easier to identify and block. This proactive approach aims to curb the rampant phone scams, particularly those impersonating official bodies like ARCEP itself.

## 8. AI Powers Real-Time Sports Commentary

A fascinating application of AI is now being deployed in sports broadcasting: real-time commentary generated by artificial intelligence. This innovative approach leverages GPS trackers and other data sources to monitor athletes in real-time, feeding this information to an AI model that generates instant updates on distances, speeds, positional changes, and even race narratives. While initial implementations focus on written commentary, the ambition is to move towards vocal commentary and visual avatars for webcasting. This technology promises to enhance coverage for smaller events lacking human commentators and provide objective, data-driven insights that even seasoned human commentators might miss. However, challenges remain, such as ensuring the AI avoids hyperbole or misinterpretations of nuanced race events.

## 9. Stargate Project and AI Investment in France

The February AI summit in Paris and the earlier US "Stargate" project highlight the global race for AI leadership. France announced significant investments, including 109 billion euros earmarked for domestic AI development and an additional 200 billion euros for Europe. While funding origins are diverse (including the UAE, Canada, and other sources), a substantial portion is reportedly secured. These funds are slated for three key areas: developing more sovereign data centers, bolstering chip manufacturing (a long-term and ambitious goal given current European chip production capabilities), and fostering innovation within the AI ecosystem, especially for French startups looking to scale up without relying solely on foreign markets. This strategic investment underscores a clear national and European push to secure their place in the global AI landscape.

## 10. The Ethical and Societal Implications of AGI

As AI capabilities rapidly advance, the discussion around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) intensifies. Experts suggest AGI, a system with human-level cognitive abilities, could be as little as five years away. This transformative potential brings both immense benefits‚Äîsuch as revolutionizing healthcare (e.g., AI-powered tuberculosis diagnosis in developing countries) and offering universal digital assistants‚Äîand profound risks. The primary concerns revolve around the "dual-use" nature of powerful AI, capable of being leveraged by malicious actors. Another crucial challenge is ensuring that future agent-based AI systems are programmed with the right values, objectives, and safeguards to prevent unintended consequences. While techno-optimism prevails, there's a strong call for societal preparedness, continuous research into safety, and proactive workforce adaptation to harness AGI for humanity's benefit while mitigating its inherent dangers.
