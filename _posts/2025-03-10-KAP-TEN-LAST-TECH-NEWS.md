### Here is the news for March 10, 2025

**Fast Internet Connection Chips :** Google unveiled the Tara T2A R1 chip, using wireless optical communication technology for high-speed data transmission. This innovation offers an alternative to traditional infrastructure (fiber optics, satellites), with speeds exceeding those of Starlink. The use of light for transmission reduces latency while increasing bandwidth.

---

**AI in Smartphones :** Artificial intelligence in smartphones has made remarkable progress. Current devices synthesize web pages, write texts, generate emails, translate instantly, edit photos, and perform intelligent searches. These capabilities make daily tasks more fluid and personalized.

---

**AI Agents**: Virtual assistants are reaching new heights with AI agents performing complex tasks. They book restaurants, plan trips, and coordinate appointments by automatically interacting with various online services, thus simplifying daily management.

---

**Smartphone Photography Enhancement**The Xiaomi 15 Ultra features a 50-megapixel main sensor (1-inch type) and a 200-megapixel periscope telephoto lens. This collaboration with Leica produces image quality rivaling professional cameras, with 4.3x optical zoom perfect for distance photography.

---

**Removable Lens Concept for Smartphones :** Xiaomi is developing removable lenses that attach to the back of smartphones. These modules, equipped with large sensors and LaserLink Communication technology, aim to offer an experience close to traditional photography.

---

**Sustainable Materials for Devices :** Sustainability is becoming a priority for manufacturers. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra illustrates this trend with its Guardian structure, combining an ultra-resistant aluminum frame and a robust back for better longevity.
