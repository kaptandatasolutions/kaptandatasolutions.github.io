## OpenAI Integrates Real-Time Web Search in ChatGPT

**OpenAI has integrated real-time web search into ChatGPT, enabling the chatbot to access up-to-date information and compete effectively with its competitors.** Initially available for paying subscribers and those on a waitlist, this feature will be gradually rolled out to all users in the coming weeks. Integration is seamless within the existing interface, automatically deciding when to use web results, while also allowing users to manually trigger searches.

- The service is available on iOS, Android, and desktop applications.
- It utilizes a mix of search technologies, including Microsoft's Bing.
- OpenAI claims there are currently no plans to integrate advertisements, unlike Google.
- OpenAI states that this integration aims to improve the overall factuality of ChatGPT’s responses.

## Freds' Growth and Challenges

**Freds, the text-focused social network, has surpassed 275 million monthly active users, marking an increase of 75 million in just three months.** Launched in July 2023 to capitalize on the user exodus from X after Elon Musk's acquisition, Freds is attracting 1 million new sign-ups daily. Despite this success, the platform faces significant challenges related to moderation, which has frustrated many users. Adam Mosseri, head of Freds and Instagram, acknowledges the work still needed, emphasizing the platform's promising potential.

## Controversial Changes to Blocking Feature on X

**X has altered its blocking feature, allowing blocked users to still view the posts, followers, and following lists of those who blocked them.** Elon Musk, owner of X, justifies this change by asserting that it makes no sense to prevent people from viewing public posts. However, this modification could facilitate harassment, especially since the platform now prevents non-logged-in users from viewing public profiles.

- Blocked users will still be unable to follow, like, reply, repost, direct message, or interact with the blocker’s posts in any way.
- This decision has raised concerns about compliance with Apple and Google’s rules on blocking abusive users.

## Meta Cancels Nuclear-Powered AI Center

**Meta has abandoned its plan to build a nuclear-powered AI center in the United States after discovering a rare species of bee at the proposed site.** Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, explained that the presence of these bees would have led to regulatory challenges making the project impossible.

- Meta could have become the first tech giant with an AI center powered in this way.
- The race to use nuclear energy for AI is intensifying, with Microsoft and Google preparing similar projects.
- Meta continues to explore various clean energy options, including nuclear, for its future data centers.

## World's First Wooden Satellite Launched

**Japanese scientists have launched IGOSAT, the world’s first wooden satellite, into space.** A collaboration between Kyoto University and Sumitomo Forestry, the satellite aims to study the resilience of wood under extreme space conditions over six months.

- IGOSAT launched aboard a SpaceX mission towards the International Space Station, from where it will be deployed at around 400 km altitude.
- The wood used is Unoki, a type of magnolia known for its strength.
- This technology could revolutionize spacecraft construction, as the absence of water and oxygen in space prevents wood from catching fire or decaying.
- Wooden satellites could also be less polluting when re-entering Earth’s atmosphere.

## Mozilla’s Restructuring and Layoffs

**Mozilla, the non-profit foundation behind Firefox, has announced a major restructuring, leading to the layoff of 30% of its workforce, or about 120 employees.** This decision mainly affects the advocacy and global program divisions and follows an earlier wave of layoffs that impacted Firefox’s development team. The restructuring aims to enhance the organization's agility and impact in its mission for a more open and equitable technology future.

## Record Fine for Apple

**Apple faces a record fine of up to $38 billion for violating the European Digital Markets Act (DMA).** This follows anti-competitive practices on the App Store, for which Apple was already fined 1.84 billion euros after a complaint from Spotify. The European Commission is expected to announce the fine’s exact amount later this month.

## Elon Musk’s Influence on Trump’s Victory

**Elon Musk has emerged as a key player in Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory.** The billionaire, who invested more than $100 million in Trump’s campaign, is already reaping the rewards:

- Tesla, of which Musk is CEO, saw a 15% rise in its stock price, boosting Musk's personal wealth by $15 billion.
- Analysts predict that this victory could add up to $200 billion to Tesla's value.

Musk also played a crucial role in Trump's campaign via X, which has become a haven for conservative voices. Trump has announced plans to appoint Musk to lead a commission on government efficiency.

## Accidental Reveal of Google’s Jarvis AI Assistant

**Google accidentally revealed Jarvis, its new AI assistant, on the Chrome Web Store before quickly pulling it back.** Scheduled for release in December 2024, this tool, powered by an advanced version of Gemini, promises to automate routine web tasks.

- This announcement aligns with the trend of tech giants competing with similar AI projects.
- These tools aim to simplify the user experience by automating routine computing tasks.

## IBM’s Quantum Breakthrough

**IBM has announced a significant breakthrough in quantum computing with the development of its new 127-qubit quantum processor named 'Eagle'.** This new quantum processor is said to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in quantum computing, with potential applications in fields ranging from cryptography to complex material simulations.

- IBM claims that 'Eagle' is the most powerful quantum processor ever built, enabling calculations that would be impossible for classical supercomputers.
- The company aims to achieve "quantum advantage"—where quantum computers solve problems faster than classical computers—within the next few years.
- This development could accelerate advancements in medicine, logistics, and data encryption, making quantum computing a more practical tool for industries globally.
