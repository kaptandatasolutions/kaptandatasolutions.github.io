## Welcome to the World of Marie and Gustave ‚Äì Your Physics Assistants!

**"Marie Curie and Gustave Roussy are here to guide you through protocols and the 2023 ANSM regulations."**

In the world of medical physics, staying up to date with protocols and regulations is a daily necessity. That‚Äôs where Marie and Gustave, your new virtual physics assistants, come in. Powered by an updated knowledge base, including the latest 2023 ANSM regulations, they are designed to help you navigate the complex universe of quality control and regulatory standards.

### 1. Meet Marie & Gustave

**Marie**: Hello, dear physicist! I'm Marie, your enlightened guide on this journey through the latest protocols and regulations.

**Gustave**: And I'm Gustave! I'm here to help you apply these protocols and find the best practices for your daily work. Together, we‚Äôre going to make sparks fly‚Ä¶ safely, of course!

### 2. Ask Us a Question!

**Marie**: Whether it‚Äôs a question about quality control for the isocenter or curiosity about new regulations, I'm here to guide you.

**Gustave**: For example, wondering, "What tests are required for isocenter quality control?" No worries, we've got the answers to help you gain clarity. I‚Äôll give you the pointers you need to shine during your next audit!

### 3. Knowledge Base Configuration

**Marie**: Currently, we are in BETA. This means our answers are based on what we know, but we might not be 100% accurate just yet.

**Gustave**: But don‚Äôt worry, we are constantly learning and evolving. And if you need something more specific, like international recommendations or internal protocols from your institution, we can integrate those into our knowledge base too.

### 4. Customizing Your Assistant

**Marie**: In our offers, we can integrate any type of knowledge base, whether it's internal operating procedures, international recommendations, or even scraping scientific websites for the latest updates.

**Gustave**: We‚Äôre here to provide you with a tailored solution that fits your needs and work environment.

### 5. You're in Control!

**Marie**: Want to know something? Go ahead! Ask your question and let us help you find the answer.

**Gustave**: And if you ever feel we still have more to learn, don‚Äôt hesitate to let us know. After all, we‚Äôre here for you!

### 6. Remember, It's a BETA

**Marie**: We‚Äôre still in BETA, so we might lack precision from time to time. But don‚Äôt worry, every day we get a little bit smarter!

**Gustave**: And don‚Äôt forget, our services can grow with you and adapt to all your knowledge requirements.

### 7. Let's Explore Together!

**Marie**: So, are you ready to explore the world of protocols and regulations with us?

**Gustave**: Let‚Äôs go! Ask your first question and let‚Äôs see what we can discover together.
