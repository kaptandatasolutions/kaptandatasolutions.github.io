# üîù Top 10 Tech News - April 22, 2025

## 1. ‚öñÔ∏è **Google found guilty of antitrust violations in the United States**
The U.S. federal court has found Google guilty of intentionally manipulating its automated advertising bidding system (ATEC), significantly restricting competition. This verdict could potentially lead to a partial dismantling of Google's advertising activities, reminiscent of historical antitrust cases such as Microsoft in the early 2000s or AT&T in the 1980s. Despite Google's immediate announcement of an appeal, the case highlights the ongoing and complex evolution of American antitrust regulation in the face of growing digital industry power.

## 2. üì± **Major antitrust trial against Meta for abuse of dominant position**
The highly publicized trial against Meta is currently underway in Washington, accusing the company of deliberately stifling competition through strategic acquisitions of popular applications like WhatsApp and Instagram. Mark Zuckerberg, personally attending the hearings, defends the acquisitions by citing continued competition from platforms such as Snapchat and TikTok. Scheduled to last two months, this trial could significantly redefine the social media landscape and permanently alter growth strategies among major tech companies.

## 3. üá™üá∫ **Meta facing GDPR constraints in AI training**
Meta plans to massively exploit personal data from Facebook and Instagram users in Europe to improve its artificial intelligence models (Meta AI). This approach, justified by Meta under the principle of "legitimate interest," employs a controversial "opt-out" mechanism, triggering negative reactions from European regulators. Ireland's DPC and NGOs such as "None of Your Business" strongly criticize this interpretation of the GDPR, viewing it as an attempt to circumvent explicit consent requirements ("opt-in"), raising significant legal and ethical questions.

## 4. ü§ñ **OpenAI introduces advanced models o3 and o4 mini**
OpenAI recently announced its new artificial intelligence models, o3 and o4 mini, notable for their sophisticated capability to integrate visual as well as textual data. These models represent a significant methodological innovation, enabling diverse applications ranging from assisted medical diagnosis to logistical planning and optimization. Their combined reasoning capabilities mark a major advancement in AI research.

## 5. üåê **OpenAI considers entering the social media market**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently floated the idea of creating a social network incorporating advanced AI functionalities. This proposition aligns with a broader trend where existing social networks, such as X (formerly Twitter), intensify their integration of artificial intelligence. This strategic move reflects the growing convergence between social platforms and AI technologies.

## 6. ‚òÅÔ∏è **Renewed French ambitions for a "sovereign cloud"**
Amid increasing geopolitical tensions and heavy technological dependence on the United States, France has renewed its ambition to develop a genuine "sovereign cloud." A dedicated observatory for digital sovereignty has been established to oversee this project, which presents both technical and economic complexities. This initiative aims to ensure national digital security and autonomy while mitigating risks related to the extraterritorial reach of American laws.

## 7. üöÄ **Jam Spot emerges as a credible alternative to American tech giants**
Jam Spot, a French provider of professional collaborative solutions, is experiencing notable growth and openly advocates for technological independence. Its ambition is to position itself as a viable alternative to Microsoft and Google, despite a significantly imbalanced competitive environment. This dynamic illustrates major strategic autonomy challenges facing European digital actors.

## 8. üõ°Ô∏è **Vision promotes the innovative concept of "dataspace"**
The company Vision proposes an innovative model called "dataspace," a technological infrastructure facilitating secure and regulated exchanges of sensitive data. This model meets the stringent requirements of the GDPR while enabling robust artificial intelligence development. The goal is to establish an architecture compatible with optimal data exploitation without compromising confidentiality or data sovereignty.

## 9. üîó **DIV Protocol revolutionizes blockchain with a post-quantum approach**
DIV Protocol distinguishes itself with blockchain technology employing decentralized methods and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Founded by Gaspar Bonau, this initiative explores concrete and secure blockchain applications, distancing itself from financial speculation. DIV Protocol thus offers enhanced personal data security and positions itself as a credible alternative to potential vulnerabilities of centralized systems.

## 10. üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è **Attempt to use an AI avatar in court rejected in the United States**
An unusual case in the United States, involving a litigant attempting to be represented in court by an artificial intelligence-generated avatar, was promptly rejected by the judge. This incident highlights current legal and institutional integration challenges of AI, underscoring existing limits regarding its acceptance in formal contexts such as judicial proceedings.
