# Top 10 Tech News of the Week

The digital landscape is constantly evolving, bringing forth new challenges and exciting innovations. This week, we dive into ten crucial developments shaping our technological future, from operating system updates to the latest in cybersecurity.

## 1. The Windows 10 End-of-Life Dilemma
The tech world is in a global panic as Microsoft prepares to cease support for Windows 10, affecting millions of computers worldwide. Starting in October 2025, Windows 10 users will no longer receive critical security updates, potentially leaving their devices vulnerable to malware and cyber threats. This move compels users to upgrade to Windows 11, which many older machines cannot support, or face significant risks. The situation has sparked a debate, with some calling it a "Windows tax," urging Microsoft to reconsider the deadline. For businesses and individuals, this signifies a significant financial burden and a critical decision point for their hardware and software infrastructure. Alternatives exist, such as migrating to Linux or Chrome OS, or paying for extended security updates, but each comes with its own set of challenges and costs.

## 2. Apple's Latest Innovations Unveiled
Apple has just released its new line of iPhones and the highly anticipated iOS 26. The new iPhones, including the iPhone 17 Pro Max and the ultra-thin iPhone, boast advanced features, though the real game-changer is iOS 26. This new operating system introduces a "Liquid Glass" design with transparent effects and floating menus, marking the first major UI overhaul in over a decade. While some initially had reservations, many are praising its aesthetic appeal and enhanced user experience. Beyond visual changes, iOS 26 also brings improvements to the camera, CarPlay, AI-powered unknown number filtering, and real-time translation—features that enhance daily productivity and communication. Similarly, Watch OS 26 for Apple Watch introduces the Liquid Glass design, alongside new health features like hypertension notifications and detailed sleep scores, leveraging AI for better health insights.

## 3. Demystifying ChatGPT Usage
A recent study by OpenAI and Harvard economists reveals fascinating insights into how 700 million weekly users interact with ChatGPT. Analyzing 1.5 million conversations, the study shows a rapid democratization of access, particularly among women and in less affluent countries. The primary use cases are diverse: nearly half of interactions involve asking for advice or information, 40% are dedicated to writing, planning, or coding (with a third for work-related tasks), and 11% are for personal reflection or entertainment. The study emphasizes ChatGPT’s growing role in decision-making and productivity, especially in intellectual professions. This points to AI becoming an increasingly central tool in both professional and personal spheres, driving economic value and continuously evolving with user needs.

## 4. Meta's Vision for Smart Glasses and the Metaverse
Meta is making a bold move into the future with its new smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Display, which integrates augmented reality and artificial intelligence. These glasses feature a small screen embedded in the lens, enabling users to receive notifications, make video calls, follow GPS directions, and conduct AI-powered searches. A groundbreaking addition is the neural wristband, which allows for intuitive control of the glasses through muscle movements, effectively acting as a "mouse" for the eyewear. This innovation addresses the challenge of interacting with smart glasses discreetly, making tasks like typing messages or adjusting volume seamless. These developments also reignite the conversation around the Metaverse, with Meta positioning these devices as key access points to a more immersive, virtualized future.

## 5. Zoom's Leap into Virtual Meetings with Avatars
Zoom is enhancing its virtual meeting platform by introducing AI-generated avatars. Users can now create a digital clone of themselves by recording a short video, which will then represent them in meetings. This feature allows individuals to participate in calls even when they are not camera-ready, maintaining presence without needing to be physically "on." The avatars can also take notes, translate speech in real-time, and act as a stand-in, offering a blend of convenience and professionalism. This innovation addresses the common dilemma of balancing participation with personal comfort, especially during extended or numerous virtual engagements.

## 6. Republic Like: A New Social Media Ethos
Amidst the pervasive "attention economy" of mainstream social media, Republic Like emerges as a refreshing alternative. This French social network aims to break away from models that monetize attention and promote sensational content. Republic Like introduces a unique "reputation system" where users are rewarded for civil and respectful engagement. Positive interactions boost visibility, while negative behavior can lead to reduced visibility or moderation. The platform explicitly avoids censorship and fosters authentic discussions, even on sensitive topics, without resorting to insults. Subscriptions are priced at €48 per year, a deliberate choice to shift away from advertising-based revenue and build a more ethical and user-centric online community.

## 7. WIRO: Europe's Digital Wallet Gains Traction
WIRO, the European electronic wallet launched in 2024, is rapidly gaining popularity, boasting over 43 million users across France, Germany, and Belgium. Integrated directly into banking applications, WIRO simplifies peer-to-peer payments. Users can send money using mobile numbers, email addresses, or QR codes, offering convenience and anonymity. The QR code feature is particularly useful for small transactions, facilitating secure payments without sharing personal details. WIRO is expanding its services to include online payments, with e-commerce integration planned for Germany and Belgium by early next year and France by summer 2026. Major retailers and public services are already committed to accepting WIRO, setting the stage for future in-store payments via QR code and contactless technology.

## 8. The Evolving Threat of Cybercrime and Human Vulnerability
Cybercrime continues to escalate, particularly with the advancements in artificial intelligence. The focus of cybercriminals is increasingly shifting from purely technical exploits to human manipulation, a tactic known as social engineering. This involves psychological manipulation to trick individuals into performing actions that compromise security, such as fraudulent bank transfers or information disclosure. Examples include phishing emails and SMS scams masquerading as parcel deliveries or urgent financial requests. While technical defenses like firewalls and anti-spam filters are robust, humans remain the "weakest link," accounting for 60-80% of successful cyberattacks.

## 9. Combatting Social Engineering with Awareness and AI
To counter sophisticated social engineering tactics, organizations are focusing on employee training and awareness. This includes educating staff on how to identify suspicious emails (e.g., misspellings, unusual sender addresses), recognizing different types of scams, and understanding company security policies. AI-powered tools are emerging as a crucial line of defense, acting as "cyber coaches" to provide real-time assistance and answer employee questions. The goal is to transform human vulnerability into a strength by fostering a proactive and security-conscious culture. The continued rise of AI means that cybercriminals can craft more convincing and large-scale attacks, making ongoing education and AI assistance essential for safeguarding digital assets.

## 10. The Seasonal and Targeted Nature of Cyberattacks
Cyberattacks often display seasonal trends, particularly consumer-focused scams. Periods like Black Friday, holidays, and other promotional events see a surge in phishing attempts, fake delivery notices, and fraudulent offers targeting individuals. For businesses, however, attacks are becoming more stable, precise, and technically intricate. Instead of broad, untargeted phishing campaigns, cybercriminals are conducting in-depth research to create highly customized scenarios. This approach, though requiring more effort, yields higher returns. Beyond email and SMS, new vectors like WhatsApp, Teams, and Slack are being exploited, showcasing the multi-channel nature of modern cyber warfare and the constant need for vigilance across all communication platforms.
