# Top 10 Tech News of the Week

This week, the tech world is buzzing with updates from major players and innovative startups alike. From Windows 10's impending end-of-life to Apple's latest releases, and from the evolving landscape of AI to new approaches to social media, there's a lot to unpack. Here's a rundown of the top 10 tech news items you need to know:

## 1. Windows 10's Impending End-of-Life: The Global Panic for PC Owners

Microsoft's ultimatum for Windows 10 users is creating a global stir. Starting October 15, 2025, Microsoft will cease security updates and support for Windows 10, a system that still powers hundreds of millions of personal and business computers worldwide. This decision, announced two years ago, has major implications. Without crucial security patches, these machines become vulnerable to malware and system failures, posing a huge risk. The problem primarily affects individual users, as well as small to medium-sized businesses, associations, and local governments that rely heavily on these older systems. The cost of upgrading entire IT infrastructures is substantial, creating a financial burden for many.

The primary solution is to upgrade to Windows 11. However, many older machines lack the processing power or specifications to run Windows 11, necessitating the purchase of new hardware. This is where the financial strain becomes evident, especially for large organizations. Microsoft is offering an alternative: users can pay an annual fee to continue receiving extended security updates. This "Windows tax," as some are calling it, is sparking protests, especially in France and the US, with consumer associations calling for a postponement of the deadline. While Microsoft's policy is currently legal, given Windows 10's age, it highlights a potential future legislative gap regarding software obsolescence. Alternatives for those unwilling to pay or upgrade include switching to operating systems like Linux or Chrome OS, though these require significant adaptation and can be less user-friendly for many.

## 2. Apple's New iPhone 17 Lineup and iOS 26 Unleashed

Apple enthusiasts have just welcomed the new iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max, and the ultra-thin iPhone Ultra into their hands. While the hardware itself is impressive, featuring advancements in display technology, camera capabilities, and processing power, the real game-changer for many users is the release of iOS 26. This new operating system is compatible with iPhones from the iPhone 11 series and the iPhone SE (2020) onwards, bringing a host of new features to a wide user base.

Among the "200 new features" touted by Apple, the most significant is the "Liquid Glass" design. This innovative aesthetic offers a transparent, water-like reflective interface with floating menus and magnifying effects. Early reactions were mixed, but many users are finding it visually stunning and a fresh departure from previous iOS designs. This represents the most significant design overhaul for the iPhone in over a decade. Beyond aesthetics, iOS 26 introduces ergonomic improvements to the camera and photo applications, a revamped CarPlay interface, and an AI-powered unknown number filtering feature, where an intelligent assistant screens calls and notifies the user via message. Real-time translation, a feature already seen in Android, is also now integrated. Furthermore, Apple Watch users receive Watch OS 26, which incorporates the Liquid Glass design and adds new health monitoring features, including hypertension notifications and a comprehensive sleep score function. These updates continue to solidify Apple's position at the forefront of mobile technology and user experience.

## 3. Demystifying AI: How Are We Really Using ChatGPT?

OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has partnered with US universities to conduct an extensive study on how its chatbot is being used by its reported 700 million weekly users. The findings offer fascinating insights into the evolving human-AI partnership. The study, analyzing 1.5 million conversations, reveals that ChatGPT's user base is rapidly diversifying, with a near-equal gender balance (women now represent 52% of users, up from 37% in January 2024). Adoption in less affluent countries is also accelerating, quadrupling compared to other regions by May 2025.

The study categorizes usage into three main areas: "Asking" (nearly half of all messages), used for practical advice, information retrieval, and general inquiries; "Doing" (40%), involving tasks like writing, planning, coding (with about a third related to work); and "Expressing" (11%), for personal reflection, creative endeavors, and entertainment. The economic impact shows a 30% professional use and 70% personal use, both growing steadily. ChatGPT is proving to be a catalyst for decision-making and productivity, particularly in intellectual professions. The study concludes that as the tool evolves, users consistently discover new applications, making ChatGPT an increasingly central and valuable tool in daily life, both professionally and personally. This research underscores the pervasive and dynamic integration of AI into our routines.

## 4. Meta's Leap into Smart Glasses: Ray-Ban Display with Neural Bracelet

Mark Zuckerberg's Meta is making a bold statement with its new smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Display, positioning them as a major step towards integrating augmented reality and AI into everyday life. Despite a few on-stage glitches during the demonstration (highlighting that the technology is still in its early stages), the potential of these glasses is immense. They combine augmented reality with a discreet screen integrated into the lens, a significant technological achievement.

The Ray-Ban Display glasses offer features like WhatsApp notifications, video calls (once the connection issues are ironed out), GPS navigation, AI-powered information retrieval, and real-time translation. These functionalities, while not entirely new to the smart gadget landscape, are packaged in a stylish and surprisingly conventional form factor. However, the most groundbreaking innovation is the neural bracelet. This wrist-worn device interprets subtle muscle movements in the wrist to allow for hands-free interaction with the glasses. Actions like "writing" in the air or simple gestures can control the device, a departure from traditional voice commands or physical button presses. This haptic input system, an evolution of concepts seen in devices like the Apple Watch, aims to provide a more intuitive and discreet user experience. While adding another device to charge nightly, this combination of AR, AI, and neural control marks a significant stride in wearable technology and potentially the metaverse itself.

## 5. The Metaverse Resurgence: From Headsets to Smart Glasses

Following the announcement of Meta's Ray-Ban Display smart glasses, the concept of the metaverse, once thought to be fading, is making a strong comeback. Mark Zuckerberg explicitly referenced the metaverse multiple times during his presentation, signaling a renewed commitment to his ambitious virtual world project. This time, however, the approach is more inclusive and diverse in its access points.

Instead of solely relying on bulky virtual reality headsets like the Quest, Meta is broadening the gateway to the metaverse. The strategy suggests that whether users choose a full VR headset or the more discreet smart glasses, they will be able to access Meta's evolving virtual ecosystem. This shift addresses a key criticism of earlier metaverse efforts – the reliance on immersion-heavy, often uncomfortable hardware. By offering more accessible and socially acceptable form factors like smart glasses, Meta aims to overcome adoption barriers. This vision aligns with the idea that the metaverse is not just a single virtual space but a tapestry of interconnected digital experiences accessible through various devices, including eventually brain-computer interfaces. The goal is to move beyond the "dinosaur avatar" stereotype and create a more seamlessly integrated, semi-virtual world that enhances daily life rather than entirely replacing it.

## 6. Zooming into the Future: Avatars in Video Conferencing

Video conferencing giant Zoom is set to revolutionize virtual meetings with the introduction of AI-powered avatars. This feature will allow users to be represented by a digital clone during calls, aiming to address common informalities of remote work while maintaining a professional presence. Users can record a two-minute video of themselves looking into the camera, from which Zoom's AI will create a personalized avatar.

This avatar can then attend meetings, freeing the human user from constant camera engagement. This is particularly useful for technical briefings or situations where active listening is required without the need for constant visual interaction. The avatar can even take notes, translate conversations in real-time, and speak in the desired language. Google Teams is reportedly exploring similar functionalities, indicating a wider industry trend towards AI-driven virtual presence. While some might see it as merely a solution for bad hair days or being in pajamas, the feature offers a polite way to participate in calls without being glued to the screen or having one's camera off — a common etiquette dilemma in virtual meetings. It's akin to the "stand-in" concept in filmmaking, where a substitute is used for lighting and setup before the star arrives, offering a flexible and less intrusive way to engage in virtual collaborations.

## 7. The Ethical Social Network: Republic Like Challenges the Attention Economy

In a bold move to counter the pervasive "attention economy" of traditional social media, a new French platform called Republic Like (pronounced "Republic" with a "K" and "E" at the end) is launching. Founded by Étienne de Sainte-Marie, Republic Like aims to liberate users from the constant scramble for clicks and engagement that often drives sensationalism and negativity. It positions itself as an "anti-social network" to the prevailing model, offering an alternative built on ethical principles.

Republic Like's core philosophy is to move away from monetization through attention and advertising. Instead, it proposes a system where user reputation is built on "virtuous metrics" rather than mere popularity or controversy. This dynamic reputation system, updated in real-time, directly influences a user's visibility and their involvement in content moderation. The idea is simple: respectful, constructive engagement earns higher scores, leading to greater visibility, while negative behavior diminishes it. While some might fear a "vanilla" or overly sanitized environment, the platform has already proven capable of handling heated discussions on sensitive topics like ecology, geopolitics (e.g., Gaza-Israel conflict), and immigration, without succumbing to insults or toxicity. The platform is subscription-based, costing around €48 per year, a deliberate choice to shift focus from ad revenue to a sustainable, user-funded model. This aims to break the financial dependency on screen time and engagement manipulation, fostering a community based on authenticity and respectful dialogue.

## 8. Wiro: Europe's Expanding Electronic Wallet for P2P Payments

Wiro (Wo), the European electronic wallet launched in 2024, is rapidly gaining traction, boasting over 43 million users across Europe (primarily France, Germany, and Belgium). Ludovic Francesconi, Wiro's Head of Development, highlights its unique integration into traditional banking applications as a key differentiator in the competitive peer-to-peer payment market. Wiro aims to simplify everyday payments by allowing users to send and receive money directly through their existing banking apps.

In France, Wiro emerged from the migration of the popular Paylib service, ensuring a smooth transition for existing users. The service offers multiple ways to connect and transfer funds: via mobile number (if the recipient is already a Wiro user, indicated by a small logo next to their contact), email address, or a highly innovative QR code system. The QR code feature allows for anonymous transactions, which is particularly useful for online marketplaces like Leboncoin, where buyers and sellers might prefer not to exchange personal contact details. Beyond P2P, Wiro is expanding into e-commerce and physical point-of-sale payments. E-commerce integration is set to launch in Germany later this year, followed by Belgium, and then France by summer 2026. Major merchants, including Leclerc, Veepee, Air France, and even French state and local government services, have already committed to accepting Wiro payments. The long-term vision includes NFC-based contactless payments, making Wiro a comprehensive, bank-integrated digital payment solution for a cashless future.

## 9. Frogan: A French Innovation Revolutionizing a Secure and Private Internet

Frogan represents a groundbreaking French-initiated technology designed to revolutionize content distribution online. It leverages mini-sites, similar to widgets, through a unique technical protocol. A standout feature of Frogan, as emphasized by co-creator Alexis Tamas, is its native security and deep respect for user privacy, distinguishing it from conventional web technologies.

Unlike websites that rely on cookies and extensive user tracking, Frogan operates without these mechanisms. When a user visits a Frogan site, their activity is not continuously tracked, nor are they "recognized" upon subsequent visits unless they actively save the site to their favorites. This gives users unprecedented control over their data, deciding precisely what information they share and with whom. This approach directly addresses growing concerns about data privacy and the intrusive nature of many online services. Frogan aims to offer a secure, private, and user-controlled environment for information exchange, fostering a more trustworthy digital ecosystem. A conference discussing Frogan's potential to redefine the internet, titled "How to Revolutionize the Internet from Paris," is scheduled for September 22nd at the Hôtel du Louvre, underscoring its significant aspirations and innovative vision.

## 10. Cybercrime's New Era: Mental Manipulation and AI-Powered Attacks

Cybercrime is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by artificial intelligence and an increased focus on human manipulation. While technical defenses against cyberattacks have advanced considerably, cybercriminals are increasingly targeting the "human element" — exploiting psychological vulnerabilities rather than purely technical ones. This phenomenon, known as social engineering, is becoming the core of 21st-century cybercrime. Arnaud Louattière, Southern Europe director at SFE, a cybersecurity firm, explains that social engineering aims to induce an individual to perform an action for the attacker through psychological means.

These attacks manifest in various forms. Simple but effective scams, like fake package delivery SMS messages targeting individuals, are rampant. In corporate settings, this translates to fraudulent requests for changing bank account details (IBANs) or manipulating document flows. While these tactics seem straightforward, AI tools are making them more sophisticated, allowing attackers to spoof emails and create convincing deceptive communications. Studies suggest that 60-80% of cyberattacks involve a human component, highlighting that the "weakest link" is often the person between the keyboard and the chair. However, SFE believes that with proper training and "cyber accompaniment," employees can become a strong defense line. This involves educating them on recognizing phishing attempts, understanding security rules, and providing continuous support through AI-powered "cyber coaches" who offer real-time advice and answer questions without fear of judgment. Cybercriminals exploit seasonality (e.g., Black Friday, holidays) for mass-scale consumer attacks, but for businesses, attacks are becoming more precise, targeted, and financially motivated, often through methods like ransomware. The channels of attack are also diversifying beyond email and SMS to include messaging apps like WhatsApp, Teams, and Slack, making vigilance and continuous training more critical than ever.
