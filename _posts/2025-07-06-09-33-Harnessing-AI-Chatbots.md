In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have become widespread tools for answering general questions, assisting with daily tasks, or providing customer support by drawing from vast amounts of online data. Yet, in specialized fields—such as medical physics and radiotherapy—precision, accuracy, and data confidentiality are paramount. To meet these critical needs, a distinct type of AI conversational assistant is emerging: chatbots trained exclusively on carefully curated, domain-specific documents.

## The Concept of Document-Centric AI Chatbots

Unlike mainstream chatbots that access expansive internet knowledge, these specialized agents rely solely on a predetermined set of documents. This method, often known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enables the AI to generate responses based strictly on the information contained within a defined corpus—be it technical guides, internal procedures, official regulations, or any proprietary knowledge base.

In practice, an organization supplies the chatbot with relevant PDFs, manuals, and other textual resources. The AI "reads" and encodes this content, then bases its replies entirely on this internal database. If a question falls outside the scope of these documents, the chatbot transparently indicates that the information is unavailable rather than fabricating an answer. This property notably mitigates a common issue in AI systems called "hallucinations," where models sometimes invent plausible but incorrect information.

## Creating Expert Virtual Assistants

This document-driven approach effectively creates an instant, tailor-made expert on very specific subjects. For example, one demo chatbot specializes in tomotherapy, a sophisticated radiotherapy technique. It answers questions by strictly referencing the proprietary guides provided, ensuring every answer is relevant and grounded in validated documentation.

Taking this a step further is another assistant named “Marie,” an homage to Marie Curie. Marie is trained exclusively on the 2023 French regulatory standards for radiotherapy safety and radioprotection (NSM 2023). This chatbot not only answers regulatory queries but also precisely cites articles and paragraph numbers within the official texts. Such explicit referencing turns the AI into a quasi-legal assistant, invaluable for compliance checks or technical validations.

## Why Operate Fully Locally?

Another fundamental advantage of these chatbots is their ability to operate completely offline, without requiring any internet connection. This local operation is particularly crucial for sectors like healthcare, where data privacy is stringently regulated by laws such as the GDPR.

Running AI tools in a closed, offline environment eliminates potential cybersecurity risks associated with network exposure. Hospitals and other sensitive institutions can thus confidently integrate these chatbots into their internal workflows, knowing that confidential data never leaves their secure infrastructure.

Furthermore, in-house deployment facilitates seamless integration into automated workflows: the chatbot can search internal documents, extract key information, assist in report generation, and interact within the organization’s systems—all while preserving data sovereignty.

## Customization and Adaptability

These AI assistants are not one-size-fits-all. Providers work closely with users to customize the knowledge base with any relevant internal documents—whether specific company procedures, regulatory texts, or specialized research papers. This adaptability empowers organizations to create their own virtual experts precisely tuned to their unique challenges and vocabularies.

## Summary: Focused AI for Precision and Trust

In essence, these demos highlight a powerful new paradigm in artificial intelligence: highly focused, document-bound conversational agents that offer reliable, auditable answers and operate with strong data governance through offline deployment.

Rather than a generalist AI that may guess or hallucinate, these tools act as specialized advisors—experts confined to their area of training yet confident and transparent. While demonstrated in medical physics and radiotherapy, this concept undeniably holds promise across numerous industries: legal firms, engineering companies, research institutions, regulatory affairs, and beyond.

At a time when abundant information often coexists with uneven trustworthiness, such tailored AI assistants present an elegant solution for delivering precise knowledge securely and efficiently.
