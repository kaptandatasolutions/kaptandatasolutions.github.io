## Introduction

Welcome to this edition of KAP10 Weekly Update, where we delve into the latest technological advancements shaping our world. This week, we explore innovations from Apple and Samsung in foldable displays and extended reality, developments in artificial intelligence at Google DeepMind, as well as the European Union's space initiatives. Additionally, we cover recent news concerning OpenAI, Instagram, META, and other significant tech industry movements.

## Apple and Foldable OLED Displays

Apple is reportedly developing an 18.8-inch foldable iPad, aiming for a release around 2028. This device is expected to feature a seamless display without visible creases, effectively resembling two iPad Pros placed side by side when unfolded. Operating on iPadOS, it may incorporate functionalities characteristic of macOS, potentially blurring the lines between tablets and laptops.

In addition, Apple is working on a foldable iPhone, with a potential launch no earlier than 2026. This model is anticipated to offer a larger display while maintaining compactness when folded, providing users with an enhanced viewing experience without compromising portability.

Regarding display technology, Apple plans to introduce OLED screens to its MacBook Pro lineup in 2026, followed by the MacBook Air in 2027. This transition to OLED is expected to deliver significant improvements in display quality, including deeper blacks and more vibrant colors, along with enhanced energy efficiency.

## Samsung's Upcoming Devices

Samsung is preparing to unveil its new Galaxy S25 series, comprising the standard S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra models, during the Galaxy Unpacked event scheduled for January 22, 2025. These smartphones are rumored to incorporate advanced artificial intelligence features, including a revamped Bixby assistant powered by large language models, potentially surpassing Apple's AI capabilities.

Additionally, Samsung is developing an extended reality (XR) headset, known as "Project Moohan," operating on Android XR. This device aims to provide immersive virtual and augmented reality experiences, with natural interaction facilitated by integrated AI technologies. The official launch is anticipated in 2025, marking Samsung's entry into the high-end XR headset market, directly competing with devices like Apple's Vision Pro.

## European Union's Space Initiatives

The European Union has signed a ‚Ç¨10.6 billion contract for the deployment of the Iris 2 satellite constellation by 2030. This ambitious program aims to rival services like Starlink, with approximately 300 satellites planned for low and medium Earth orbits. The project's cost has increased by 76% from initial estimates and will be financed 61% through public funds. Iris 2 is designed to provide secure and resilient connectivity across Europe, enhancing the EU's strategic autonomy in the space sector.

## Google DeepMind's AI Developments

Google DeepMind has unveiled VO2, a new artificial intelligence system capable of generating videos exceeding two minutes in 4K resolution. Currently available through Google's experimental V Fix tool with certain limitations, VO2 aims to surpass the capabilities of previous models, offering expanded possibilities in AI-assisted video content creation.

Furthermore, Google has released an advanced experimental version of Gemini 2.0, named Gemini EXP 1206, for subscribers of Gemini Advance. This iteration enhances performance in programming, mathematics, and reasoning tasks, though it remains limited by the lack of real-time information access. These advancements reflect Google's commitment to strengthening its AI models for increasingly complex and diverse applications.

## OpenAI's ChatGPT Search Accessibility

OpenAI has made ChatGPT Search accessible to all users, including those with free accounts. This feature enables real-time web searches through an intuitive interface and can be configured as the default search engine. This move aims to democratize access to advanced AI-assisted search capabilities, facilitating the retrieval of precise and up-to-date information for a broad audience.

## Instagram's Scheduled Posts Feature

Instagram has announced the upcoming rollout of a feature allowing users to schedule posts on its microblogging platform, Threads. This option, which will not extend to replies to preserve conversational spontaneity, offers users greater flexibility in content management. Threads now boasts over 100 million daily users and 300 million monthly active users, indicating rapid adoption and significant growth of the platform.

## Data Protection Commission's Fine on META

The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has imposed a ‚Ç¨251 million fine on META following a security breach in 2018. This incident exposed the personal data of 29 million Facebook users, including 3 million in Europe. The penalties include ‚Ç¨11 million for inadequate breach notification and ‚Ç¨240 million for non-compliance with data protection principles. This enforcement action underscores the importance of robust data protection measures and timely communication in the event of security incidents.

## LG's Wireless TV Technology Expansion

LG is set to introduce its Zero Connect Box technology, initially showcased with the M Series OLED in 2023, to its QNED Evo Mini LED lineup in 2025. This box wirelessly transmits audio and video signals to the TV, allowing for up to 4K resolution at 144Hz. The QNED Evo series will also feature a proprietary Dynamic QNED Color Solution for more realistic color representation. Additionally, LG is integrating advanced AI features, including a new AI button on the Magic Remote for personalized searches and enhanced TV functionality.
