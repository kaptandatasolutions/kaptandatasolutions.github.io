## Cyberattack on SFR Exposes Millions of Subscribers' Data

On November 24, 2024, the hacker group Near2tlg claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on French telecom operator SFR, alleging the theft of personal data from 3.6 million subscribers. The compromised information includes names, addresses, birth dates, and phone numbers. Initially, the group offered the data for sale at ‚Ç¨500 in cryptocurrency but later released it for free on Telegram after SFR denied any new data breach. Near2tlg has also targeted companies like Direct Assurance and is reportedly planning attacks on entities such as SNCF and the Banque de France.

## Sony's Return to the Portable Console Market

Sony is reportedly developing a new handheld console designed to play PlayStation 5 games on the go. Unlike the PlayStation Portal, which requires a Wi-Fi connection for game streaming, this upcoming device aims to allow direct gameplay without an internet connection. Currently in the early stages of development, the console is expected to launch in several years, positioning Sony to compete with Nintendo and Microsoft in the portable gaming market.

## Nvidia Introduces Fugatto: A Revolutionary AI Audio Tool

Nvidia has unveiled Fugatto, an AI model capable of creating and modifying audio content based on simple text prompts. This technology has potential applications in music production, video game development, and educational content creation. Fugatto can combine various instructions to generate complex sound effects. However, Nvidia has not announced a public release date for this tool.

## Google Faces ‚Ç¨7 Billion Class Action Lawsuit in the UK

Google is confronting a ¬£7 billion class action lawsuit in the United Kingdom, accused of abusing its dominant position in the online search market, leading to artificially inflated advertising costs. Allegations include compelling Android phone manufacturers to integrate Google services and financial agreements with Apple to maintain Google as the default search engine on Safari. This lawsuit adds to a series of global legal challenges facing Google.
## Bluesky Under EU Scrutiny for Transparency Violations

The European Commission has flagged social media platform Bluesky for failing to comply with EU transparency regulations. Specifically, Bluesky has not provided mandatory information regarding its number of European users and its legal establishment within the European Economic Area. Although it currently avoids classification as a very large online platform, its rapid growth could soon subject it to full jurisdiction under the Digital Services Act.

## Technical Challenges in Developing Apple's iPhone 17 Slim

Apple is reportedly working on an exceptionally thin iPhone model, the iPhone 17 Slim, with a thickness of less than 6 mm. Integrating essential components such as the SIM card, battery, and cooling system presents significant challenges. The new model is expected to feature a sleek design and a premium price point.

## Major Outage Affects Microsoft Services

A significant outage recently impacted Microsoft services, including Outlook and Microsoft Teams. The incident was caused by a faulty software update, and full restoration of affected servers took longer than anticipated.

## Huawei Launches HarmonyOS Next with New Smartphones

Huawei has introduced HarmonyOS Next, a mobile operating system entirely developed in-house. This launch coincides with the release of the Mate 70 series and the foldable Mate X6 smartphones, reflecting Huawei's strategy to reduce reliance on American technologies.

## Legal Action Against HP for Planned Obsolescence

The French association Halte √† l'Obsolescence Programm√©e (HOP) has filed a legal complaint against HP, accusing the company of implementing strategies aimed at deliberately reducing the lifespan of ink cartridges.

## Perplexity Explores Hardware with Affordable Voice Assistant

Perplexity, an AI-driven search engine company, is exploring the development of a voice-controlled hardware device. Announced by CEO Aravind Srinivas on social media, the planned device aims to answer questions effectively at an affordable price, set under $50. This initiative aligns with the trend among AI companies to expand into hardware.

## OpenAI's Sora Video Generator Leaked in Protest

A group of artists leaked access to OpenAI's unreleased text-to-video AI model, Sora, to protest the company's exploitation of their labor. These beta testers accused OpenAI of using them for unpaid research and PR, providing free testing and feedback without compensation, and helping to add artistic credibility ("art washing") to the product. The leaked tool allowed people to generate numerous AI videos resembling the company's demos before OpenAI shut down access. OpenAI responded by asserting that participation in the research preview was voluntary and that it had been supporting artists through grants and other programs.

Stay tuned to KAP10 for the latest updates and in-depth analyses of technological advancements and industry developments.
