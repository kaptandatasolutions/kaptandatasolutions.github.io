## Cyberattack on SFR Exposes Millions of Subscribers' Data

On November 24, 2024, the hacker group Near2tlg claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on SFR, one of France's leading telecommunications providers. The group alleges that they have stolen personal data of 3.6 million subscribers, including names, addresses, birth dates, and phone numbers. Initially, Near2tlg offered the data for sale at €500 in cryptocurrency. However, after SFR denied any new data breach, the hackers released the information for free on Telegram. This incident follows previous attacks by the same group on companies like Direct Assurance and raises concerns about the security measures in place to protect customer data. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
