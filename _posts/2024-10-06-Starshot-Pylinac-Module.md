# Discover the Automated **Starshot** Analysis Tool by Kaptan Data Solutions

At **Kaptan Data Solutions**, we're pushing the boundaries of efficiency and precision for medical physicists. Our latest tool revolutionizes **Starshot analysis**‚Äîautomating the entire process to save you time while maintaining the highest level of accuracy. Built with **PYLINAC**, a well-established Python library designed specifically for quality assurance in radiotherapy, our tool integrates the **Starshot** module to deliver seamless and highly accurate analysis results with minimal input from the user.

Using the powerful `starshot.analyze()` function from PYLINAC [(documentation)](https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starshot_docs.html), our tool automatically detects radiation beam lines from images and evaluates isocenter accuracy with unparalleled precision.

### Complete Flexibility Over Analysis Options

Our Starshot tool doesn‚Äôt just automate the process‚Äîit empowers you to fine-tune it. With the ability to customize key analysis parameters such as **tolerance values** and **minimum peak height**, you can adjust the tool to suit specific clinical needs. Whether you're working with gantry, collimator, or jaw bank images, the tool adapts easily to your requirements.

Key adjustable options include:
- **Percentage distance** from the starting point to the nearest image edge for optimal radiation line detection.
- **Minimum peak height percentage** to control sensitivity to noise or weaker beam signals.
- **Tolerance settings** in millimeters, defining pass/fail criteria for the analysis.
