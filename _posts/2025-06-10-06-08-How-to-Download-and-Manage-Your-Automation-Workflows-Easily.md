In today’s digital landscape, automating workflows can significantly boost productivity. This guide explains a simple, step-by-step process to download, install, and manage your workflows on an NN server. The video tutorial walks you through finding workflows on an official creator profile, downloading them, and making informed choices about server hosting – whether by using the official NN server or opting for a more flexible and cost‑efficient alternative.

Below is a breakdown of the process explained in the video, offering clear insights into how you can get started with creating and testing your own automation workflows.

Step 1: Accessing Your Workflow Repository

Once you decide to work on new or existing workflows, visit the official creator profile where all workflows are grouped together. Here, you will find a detailed description for each workflow along with a dedicated download button. The process is simple:
• Navigate to the workflow of interest.
• Read through its description and details.
• Click the download button to either import it directly on your NN server or manually copy its source code.

Step 2: Choosing the Right Workflow Installation Method

After selecting a workflow, you have two primary options:
• Install the workflow directly on your NN server with a single click.
• Copy the source code if you plan to review or tweak it before running the automation.

The video advises that managing your own NN server offers greater flexibility compared to relying solely on predefined limits.

Step 3: Setting Up an NN Server – Options and Considerations

The tutorial highlights two methods to get an NN server running:
• Create an account on the official NN server platform. Note that the pricing can be relatively high (around $20 to $24 per month when paying monthly, with a limitation of only five active workflows).
• Alternatively, consider hosting your NN server on a third-party platform that offers an unlimited server setup. This option gives you the ability to choose your number of processors (options include 1, 2, 4, or 8 processors) based on your requirements. For many users, a dual-processor setup is more than sufficient for quick execution.
  
A discount coupon (using a specific code) might be available for a limited number of users on the alternative hosting service. With pricing as low as approximately €5 per month (after applying the coupon), this option becomes very attractive. Be aware that the coupon may be capped at a certain number of redemptions, so it is wise to act promptly.

Step 4: Enhancing Your Workflow Experience with Training and Documentation

The video also emphasizes the benefit of additional training materials and documentation:
• Download comprehensive documentation that details the code used to create each workflow by simply providing your email address.
• Subscribe to a newsletter to receive future workflows and updates in advance.
• For beginners, a free training course is available that covers setting up a workflow from scratch. This course, lasting around two to three hours, guides you through each step, from installing a module (such as Telegram) to configuring every part of the automation process.

This well-organized approach makes it easy for anyone—regardless of technical skill—to master the art of workflow automation while understanding both the quick setup and the deeper details of how each workflow is constructed.

Conclusion

By following the steps above, you can efficiently download and manage your workflows while choosing the hosting option that best fits your needs and budget. Whether you decide to use the official platform or an unlimited hosting solution, these methods empower you to test, learn, and perfect your automation projects. Explore the training courses, take advantage of available coupons, and dive into the process with confidence to build a robust automated system.
