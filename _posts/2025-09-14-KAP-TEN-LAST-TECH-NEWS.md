# Top 10 Tech News of the Week

This week in the digital world, we’ve seen a diverse range of headlines, from the controversial suggestion of a digital curfew for minors to groundbreaking advancements in AI and strategic moves in the tech industry. Let's dive into the top 10 most impactful stories.

## 1. Digital Curfew for Minors

A parliamentary report has ignited debate by advocating for a *digital curfew* for minors, particularly targeting social networks like TikTok. Following growing concerns about the impact of social media on the mental and physical health of young people, the report suggests banning social media for those under 15 and implementing a nighttime block for 15–18-year-olds from 10 PM to 8 AM. This proposal comes amidst increasing testimonies from young users, especially adolescent girls, describing how algorithms can push them towards harmful content related to anorexia, self-harm, or suicide after initial exposure. While the intent to protect is clear, the technical feasibility and potential for circumvention raise significant questions. Some lawmakers are even considering legal action against platforms like TikTok for "endangering" young users, highlighting the severity of the perceived threat.

## 2. Apple's New iPhones and Wearables

Apple's traditional keynote event unveiled the new iPhone 17 lineup (17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max) alongside new Apple Watches and AirPods. The standout device was the iPhone Air, an ultra-thin model measuring just 5.6 mm thick, making it one of the thinnest on the market. Notably, this model will be available in France exclusively with an eSIM, eliminating the physical SIM card slot. While eSIMs offer convenience and multi-line capability, this move could pose challenges in regions without widespread eSIM support. Concerns about the iPhone Air's autonomy and durability have also surfaced despite Apple's titanium construction claims.

The Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 were announced with a highly anticipated blood pressure measurement feature, which will also be available on older models via a software update. However, regulatory approvals mean this functionality won't immediately launch in Europe or the US. Similarly, the new AirPods 3 boast improved noise reduction and simultaneous translation. While this translation feature is a significant enhancement, it too faces availability restrictions in Europe due to regulatory hurdles, although it might work if purchased abroad and paired with a compatible iPhone (15 Pro, 16, or 17).

## 3. TikTok Under Fire

TikTok continues to face scrutiny, particularly from French parliamentarians. The recent report severely criticizes the platform and other social media for their harmful effects on young users. Testimonies suggest TikTok's algorithm disproportionately pushes distressing content, creating a dangerous trap for vulnerable adolescents. Consequently, a French deputy has announced plans to file a lawsuit against TikTok for putting young users at risk. TikTok, in response, has vehemently denied these accusations, calling the parliamentary report a "misleading presentation" of its application. This ongoing battle highlights growing global concerns about algorithmic recommendations and their impact on mental health, mirroring similar debates about AI chatbots in the US that have been linked to tragic incidents.

## 4. China's AI Chip Race

China is making significant strides towards digital sovereignty with Alibaba and Baidu announcing the production of their own AI chips. This strategic move aims to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly American giant Nvidia, which has been subject to US export controls on advanced chips. While Huawei had already begun offering some solutions, Alibaba and Baidu's entry signifies a serious commitment to developing indigenous chip capabilities. This initiative is a direct response to protectionist measures and trade tensions, as China seeks to control its crucial AI infrastructure. The long-term challenge, however, will be matching the technological prowess of leading global manufacturers, especially given the current reliance on advanced equipment from companies like ASML for cutting-edge chip fabrication.

## 5. Mistral AI and ASML Partnership

In a significant European tech development, French startup Mistral AI and Dutch giant ASML have forged a strategic partnership. ASML, the world's sole supplier of highly advanced photolithography machines essential for producing next-generation AI chips, is investing 1.7 billion euros in Mistral. This investment propels Mistral's valuation to 11.7 billion euros, cementing its status as Europe's first "decacorn"—a startup valued over 10 billion dollars. This collaboration is seen as a crucial step towards European digital sovereignty, demonstrating a concerted effort to compete with US tech giants like OpenAI, even though Mistral's valuation, while impressive, remains a fraction of OpenAI's projected 500 billion dollars. Both companies currently operate without significant profits, reflecting the intense race for dominance in the burgeoning AI market.

## 6. Albania's AI Minister

In an unprecedented move demonstrating the growing integration of AI into governance, Albania has appointed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to a ministerial position. Named Diela, meaning "sun" in Albanian, this virtual minister will oversee public procurement processes. This unique initiative aims to combat corruption and enhance efficiency in public contracts. Diela effectively upgrades a pre-existing chatbot that provided companies with information and documents related to public tenders. Breaking new ground, the AI minister will even have the authority to recruit global talent. While symbolizing a futuristic approach to governance, the long-term implications and oversight mechanisms for an AI in such a critical role remain to be seen.

## 7. Stéphane Mallat's CNRS Gold Medal

Stéphane Mallat, a 62-year-old French mathematician, has been awarded the CNRS Gold Medal, one of France's most prestigious scientific honors. Mallat is recognized for his pioneering work in data storage and artificial intelligence. His significant contributions include the development of wavelets, a mathematical tool crucial for image compression (partially underpinning the JPEG 2000 standard) and efficient signal analysis. He has also delved into the mathematical foundations of artificial neural networks, enhancing our understanding of deep learning and generative AI. Beyond theoretical research, Mallat is a prolific innovator, holding 10 international patents and founding the startup Letit Wave, which develops technologies to improve video definition, underscoring his ability to translate pure mathematics into concrete, real-world applications.

## 8. Anti-AI Scraping Protocol (RSL)

As legal battles intensify against AI firms for "scraping" vast amounts of online content without permission to train their models, a new protocol called **Really Simple Licensing (RSL)** has emerged. Developed by content publishers, RSL aims to prevent unauthorized data extraction by AI. Essentially, RSL proposes a standardized framework for websites to embed licensing terms and payment conditions directly into their code (via the robots.txt file). This would allow content creators to monetize AI access to their data through subscriptions or per-use fees, offering a potential solution to copyright infringement and providing a new revenue stream. While currently a proposal, RSL's success hinges on adoption by major AI companies and the development of technical and legal enforcement mechanisms akin to those in the music industry.

## 9. Frogans - A Secure, Privacy-Respecting Web Protocol

Frogans, a French-initiated technology, is presented as an innovative and secure way to share content via "mini-sites" that function like widgets. Its creators emphasize its native security and respect for user privacy, distinguishing it from traditional web protocols. A key feature is its cookie-less design; users are not tracked or recognized on subsequent visits unless they intentionally bookmark a Frogans site. This gives users complete control over the data they share and with whom. Frogans positions itself as a potential revolution in internet usage, prioritizing user agency and data protection. Information sessions are being held in Paris to explore its potential, highlighting a growing demand for privacy-centric online experiences.

## 10. EDF's AI-Powered Science Fiction Book on Energy

EDF, the French energy giant, has ventured into the world of science fiction with a new book titled "Haute Tension" (High Voltage), published by Talandier. This collection of nine fictional narratives explores "game changers" – disruptive innovations or events that could fundamentally alter the energy landscape. The book, a collaboration with writers like Romain Lucaso, aims to make complex energy concepts accessible to the public and stimulate reflection on long-term energy choices. One compelling story imagines an AI inheriting the knowledge of a retired nuclear engineer to combat malicious cyber attacks or psychological manipulation, blending human experience with artificial intelligence. Another scenario delves into tech giants (GAMAF) taking control of energy production for their own data centers, posing questions about energy autonomy, control, and societal impact, leading to chilling futuristic domestic disruptions. The book acts as a pedagogical tool, encouraging readers to consider the broader implications of energy decisions beyond mere cost, touching on themes of national sovereignty, economic impact, and future societal transformations.
