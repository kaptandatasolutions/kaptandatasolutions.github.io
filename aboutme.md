# Kaptan Data Solutions - Portfolio

Welcome to **Kaptan Data Solutions (KDS)**, where we craft elegant solutions to meet the data science needs in the field of medical physics, companies, laboratories, and institutions. We believe in a world where your data is as sharp as a fencing foil and as loyal as a true friend.

## Launch of Our Portfolio

In August 2024, we launched our blog [Kaptan-Data](https://kaptan-data.streamlit.app/), a showcase dedicated to the innovative solutions we offer to facilitate data analysis and visualization in medical physics. This site allows you to explore demo versions (non-automated) of our QA tools, enabling you to assess their suitability before fully integrating them into your environment.

> "We are a French startup specializing in creating innovative web applications focused on data science and interactive data visualization. Our mission is to precisely address the specific needs of companies, laboratories, and institutions by offering high-performance, intuitive tools designed to simplify and accelerate research, analysis, and data utilization.

Although our expertise is widely recognized in medical physics, where we actively contribute to optimizing research and operations through innovative tools for processing and visualizing complex data, our scope extends far beyond. We also operate across various other sectors such as industry, environment, finance, biotechnology, and energy, consistently delivering tailored and personalized solutions.

Leveraging advanced technologies and multidisciplinary experience, we assist our clients in harnessing the value of their data, enabling informed decision-making, enhancing operational performance, and maintaining competitiveness within their respective fields.

### Our Solutions

Our demos provide a glimpse into the tools we've developed to enhance data management and improve the quality processes in your medical physics practice. Whether you opt for local deployment or a secure SaaS model, **KAPTAN DATA SOLUTIONS** ensures a smooth and secure experience.

On our site, you'll find a selection of demo tools that highlight our capabilities. These demos are non-automated, giving you complete control over testing each feature manually, so you can determine how these solutions fit your specific needs.

### Founded by Kayhan Kaptan

**Kayhan Kaptan**, a specialist in medical physics and quality management, is the founder of **Kaptan Data Solutions**. He personally oversees that every solution reflects his expertise and commitment to delivering innovative and secure tools.

## Our Story

Once upon a time, there was an urgent need for tools to help medical physicists make sense of their data. And thus, **Kaptan Data Solutions** was born, with a simple mission: to create software that is not only functional but also a joy to use.

> "Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who tells you differently is selling something."

While we acknowledge the challenges faced by medical physicists, we firmly believe that our solutions can ease some of that burden.

## Our Values

- **Excellence:** We always strive for greatness, just like Marie Curie.
- **Innovation:** We're constantly innovating, inspired by pioneers like Étienne-Jules Marey.
- **Partnership:** Collaboration is key to success, as Einstein so passionately believed.

## Conclusion

Our mission is to bring the power of Python directly to your network, freeing you from repetitive tasks that add no real value, such as data collection, creating charts or tables, copy-pasting, or sorting. While these tasks are important, they don't need to be done manually by you.

We are here to turn your ideas into reality by designing tailor-made solutions. Thanks to **Kayhan’s** expertise, acquired from working in major radiotherapy centers, we can also offer innovative approaches and solutions tailored to your specific needs.

The demo tools are currently manual and not yet automated, but keep in mind that what you’re doing today with your mouse will soon no longer be necessary. These actions will remain relevant only for fine-tuning and parameter adjustments, while automation takes over the repetitive tasks.

If you're ready to embark on a data-driven adventure, join us.
